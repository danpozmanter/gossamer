//! Bytecode-VM coverage for `static mut` storage.
//!
//! A mutable static is backed by a single shared cell (`Global::MutStatic`)
//! that every reader and writer — including spawned goroutines, which clone
//! the globals `Arc` — observes. These tests pin the single-threaded
//! read/write semantics and the cross-goroutine sharing.
