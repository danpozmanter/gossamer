//! Coroutine stack + panic propagation regression tests.
//!
//! The crate has 3 unit tests in `lib.rs` covering the basic
//! lifecycle. None of them touch deep recursion (does the
//! guard-page trip cleanly?) or panic propagation (does
//! `panic!()` inside a goroutine surface to the caller of
//! `resume()` without poisoning the worker?). Both classes
//! have shipped past regressions in similar runtimes.
//!
//! These tests are deliberately conservative - they don't
//! attempt to exercise migration across worker threads (that's
//! `gossamer-runtime::sched`'s domain) or stack growth (the
//! coro crate uses a fixed `DefaultStack`). They pin the two
//! invariants the crate documents:
//!
//!   1. A panic on the goroutine's stack propagates to the
//!      `resume()` caller as a Rust panic - no UB, no silent
//!      swallow.
//!   2. Deep recursion that touches the guard page traps via
//!      the OS, not via undefined behaviour. We don't actually
//!      trigger the guard page here - that would terminate the
//!      test binary - but we exercise the next-best signal:
//!      large-but-bounded recursion completes cleanly with
//!      the configured stack size.
