//! Lifetime of the child processes a `gos` command starts.
//!
//! A test worker runs in its own process group so a per-test timeout can end
//! the whole tree it built rather than the one process the toolchain holds a
//! handle to. That group is also what the terminal's Ctrl-C never reaches:
//! the shell signals the foreground group, and a worker in a group of its own
//! is not in it. The toolchain therefore owns the lifetime itself - every
//! child it starts is registered here, an interrupt kills each registered
//! group before the command exits, and a registration is a guard, so a child
//! is unregistered on every path out of the frame that started it.
