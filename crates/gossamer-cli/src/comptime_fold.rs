//! Comptime fold pass.
//!
//! `comptime { ... }` blocks and `comptime fn` calls are evaluated on
//! the bytecode VM during compilation and spliced back into the source
//! as literals. Running once here, ahead of the per-tier pipelines,
//! guarantees the bytecode VM, the Cranelift JIT, and the LLVM AOT
//! backend all compile the identical constant - comptime never reaches
//! a backend.
//!
//! The evaluation-and-splice core is `gossamer_interp::fold_into_source`
//! (shared with the wasm playground); this wrapper runs the front-end
//! gate over the already-augmented source and hands the lowered program
//! to the core. Programs with no `comptime` spelling skip the whole
//! pass.
